      Class and ID have very similar results when using CSS.  It is important to make note of these differences and to use them when it is appropriate.

    <p>
         Traditionally, classes are an element that are used for the purpose of resusing again later within your code.  ID's on the other hand are elements that are used to style in a specific area that you don't think that you will need to be applied again, unless of course you are using the ID as an anchor for a single page website which is rare, yet still altogether possible.

    <p>
      In order to keep your code clean and clear from clutter, your best bet is to stick with CLASS.
